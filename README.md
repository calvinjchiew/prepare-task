# Malaria Report Task
This task is for candidates applying to the position of Data Analyst / Data Scientist in the Programme for Research in Epidemic Preparedness and Response (PREPARE).

## Background
Malaria transmission occurs in 85 countries across five World Health Organisation (WHO) regions. Disease burden is heaviest in the WHO African Region. In 2020, there were 241 million cases of malaria and 627,000 malaria deaths globally. The increases in malaria cases and deaths in 2020 compared to 2019 were associated with disruption to services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More background information on malaria can be found [here](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria).

## Datasets
You have been tasked to write a short report on the global fight against malaria using 6 datasets below from the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s [Global Health Observatory](https://www.who.int/data/gho). These datasets contain country-level information on malaria cases and deaths, and treatment and intervention coverage over time.

No. | Dataset  | Description
--- | -------- | --------
(1) |  TOTAL_CASES | Total number of malaria cases
(2) |  EST_INCIDENCE | Estimated malaria incidence (per 1000 population at risk)
(3) |  EST_MORTALITY | Estimated malaria mortality rate (per 100,000 population)
(4) |  1STLINE_TREATED | Number of malaria cases treated with any first-line treatment courses (including artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs))
(5) | IPTP3_COVERAGE   | Pregnant women attending antenatal care at least once and receiving at least 3 doses of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria for Pregnant Women (IPTp3) (%)
(6) | ITN_COVERAGE   | Population with access to an insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) for malaria protection (%)

In addition, you have the following data dictionaries to help you.

File  | Description
-------- | --------
COUNTRY_CODE  | Country codes
UNREGION_CODE | UN region codes
