# Malaria Report Task
This task is for candidates applying to the position of Data Analyst / Data Scientist in the Programme for Research in Epidemic Preparedness and Response (PREPARE).

## Background
Malaria transmission occurs in 85 countries across five WHO regions. Since 2015, the WHO European Region has been free of malaria. 


According to the World Malaria Report 2020, there were 241 million cases of malaria globally in 2020 (uncertainty range 218–269 million) and 627 000 malaria deaths (uncertainty range 583–765 thousand). Malaria case incidence reduced from 81 in 2000 to 59 in 2015 and 56 in 2019, before increasing again to 59 in 2020. Globally, malaria deaths reduced steadily over the period 2000–2019, from 896 000 in 2000 to 562 000 in 2015 and to 558 000 in 2019. In 2020, malaria deaths increased by 12% compared with 2019. The increases in malaria cases are deaths were associated with disruption to services during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Malaria burden was heaviest in the WHO African Region, with an estimated 95% of cases and 96% of deaths; 80% of all deaths in this region are among children aged under 5 years.
